# Weather-app
This is just a _"Weather app"_ made in [Angular2][1], following the Alejandro Rangel's [course in Udemy][2].

To run the project, you should type in the terminal: `npm start`. (All the **.js** and **.js.map** files are excluded in the repo due they are generated automatically when you run this command).
